## Task 1: Sequential Sort

> We chose to implement QuickSort.

Source file:
- `src/SequentialSort.java`

Test file:
- `tests/TestSequential.java`

## Task 2: Amdahl's Law

> Our Amdahl's law is $S=\frac{1}{(1âˆ’P)+\frac{P\cdot{}E(N)}{N}}$, where $E(N)$ is the parallel efficiency.
> The parallel efficiency is a function of N, but it is also affected by the computational power of the hardware.

> For simplicity, we assume that E(N) is $N^{1/9}$ in plotting for N < 512.

Source file:
- `plots/MyAmdahlPlot.java`

Here is a plot of our version of Amdahl's law.

> We see that it is very close to the original Amdahl's law.

> We also noticed that if the array size is small, 
> e.g., less than 100, parallelization hardly gives any improvements on the execution time.

## Task 3: ExecutorServiceSort

Source file:
- `src/ExecutorServiceSort.java`

Test file:
- `tests/TestExecutorService.java`

> We decided to use `newFixedThreadPool` of `ExecutorService`. 

> We also decided to run the tasks directly if threads are not available. 
> Because if the tasks recursively submit more child tasks and there aren't enough threads to execute them, 
> it can lead to the deadlock where child tasks are waiting for parent tasks to finish, 
> but the parent tasks are waiting for the child tasks to complete.

> Additionally, we parallelize only the left branch of recursive calls 
> to minimize contention and reduce the overhead associated with parallelizing both subtasks. 
> As a result, the performance is improved by roughly 30%.

> NOTICE: The current ver. of ExecutorServiceSort has race conditions as mentioned in Task 7!

## Task 4: ForkJoinPoolSort

Source file:
- `src/ForkJoinPoolSort.java`

Test file:
- `tests/TestForkJoinPool.java`

> We decided to use parallelism effectively by dividing the array into sub-arrays 
> and fork the tasks to execute them in parallel.

## Task 5: ParallelStreamSort

Source file:
- `src/ParallelStreamSort.java`

Test file:
- `tests/TestParallelStream.java`

> We decided to use streams and their parallel processing capabilities. 

> At first, we used this method to fork the parallel stream tasks. 
> However, this method actually utilizes the ForkJoinPoll `commonPool` for parallelism.
> 
> ```java
> ForkJoinTask<?> leftTask = pool.commonPool().submit(() -> {
>     Arrays.stream(new int[]{0}).parallel()
>           .forEach(i -> parallelQuickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1));
> });
> ```

> Then we modify the method as follows.
> However, the code is still not an effective way to parallelize the quicksort algorithm. 
> `Arrays.stream(new int[] {0})` creates a stream from an array with just a single element, `0`. 
> 
> This doesn't result in any real parallelism, as the stream contains only one element. 
> Thereby, `forEach()` executes the lambda expression just once, as there's only one element to process in the stream.
> 
> ```java
> Arrays.stream(new int[]{0}).parallel()
>       .forEach(i -> parallelQuickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1));
> 
> ```

> After that, we changed the code as follows.
> 
> ```java
> // Parallelize the two recursive calls with streams
> Arrays.stream(new int[] {0, 1}).parallel()
>       .forEach(i -> {
>                   if (i == 0) {
>                       parallelQuickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
>                   } else {
>                       parallelQuickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
>                   }
>       });
> 
> ```
> 
> `.parallel()` converts the stream into a parallel stream. 
> It allows the subsequent operations to be performed concurrently if the system resources permit.
> 
> `.forEach(...)` is a terminal operation that performs an action for each element in the stream.
> In this case, it's used to execute our sorting logic.
>
> Inside the lambda function:
> - If i is 0, it calls parallelQuickSort on the left partition (low to pivotIndex - 1).
> - If i is 1, it calls parallelQuickSort on the right partition (pivotIndex + 1 to high).

## Task 6: Performance measurements with PDC

> We decided to sort 10,000,000 integers.

Source file:
- `plots/MyPDCCode.java` (Run on PDC)
- `plots/MyPDCPlot.java` (Run Locally)

![pdc plot](data/my_pdc.png)

> We see that the `ForkJoinPoolSort` show better performance with larger thread counts due to more efficient parallelism.
> These results show the importance of balancing parallelism with overhead and optimizing thread utilization 
> to achieve effective performance gains.

## Task 7: ThreadSort

Source file:
- `src/ThreadSort.java`

Test file:
- `tests/ThreadSort.java`

> We utilize `start()` and `join()` from Java's Threads to achieve parallelism, and 
> keep track of the num of active threads using the `AtomicInteger` type.

> At first, we use both `atomicInteger.get()` and `atomicInteger.incrementAndGet()` calls. 
> 
> However, separating the `get()` and `incrementAndGet()` calls can lead to a race condition, 
> where multiple threads may read the same value of activeThreads before any updates are made.
>
> ```java
> 
> 
> 
> ```
> 
> Although both `get()` and `incrementAndGet()` are atomic individually,
> when used separately, the overall process is NOT atomic.

> Finally, we changed the code as follows using `compareAndSet()`. 
>
> ```java
> 
> 
> 
> ```
> 
> Another valid method to ensure the process atomic is using a lock (e.g., `ReentrantLock` in Java) yourself. 
> 
> While `AtomicInteger` provides non-blocking operations for atomic updates, using a `lock` allows you 
> to explicitly define a critical section, making the operations within that section mutually exclusive.

## Overall Comments & Discussion

> All sorting implmemtations here use recursive calls for parallelism. However, massive recursive calls 
> may lead to stack overflow problem if array size goes beyond certain level. While non-recursive sort 
> is a solution, achieving parallelism here is not an easy topic.
